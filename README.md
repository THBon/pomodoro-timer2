This project is a part of my learning to extend my coding experiences.


In this project, I want to develop a digital concept of the pomodoro timer that helps users manage their time between study and break. This is important because study finds that studying for too long can cause people's mind to wanders. It is efficient to take a break every now and then to refresh your mind. This tool will act as a reminder intended to help you do that.

This project features:

-Customizable study session timer

-Customizable break timer

-Simplistic user-interface

This project was built using Javascript, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap
